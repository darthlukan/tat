As he spoke with her, he learned that her friend’s older boyfriend was trying to force her into prostitution. After she had refused and argued with him, he dumped her in the parking lot and sped off.</p><p>She was cold, exhausted, had no money, no identification, was carrying everything she owned in her arms and was desperate to get back home to Las Vegas. At that point, Arian told her, “I will find a way to get you home.” After getting her warm and giving her water to drink, Arian looked at one of the two TAT stickers prominently displayed on his window (which the victim had been eye-level with when she knocked on his door) and called the National Human Trafficking Hotline.</p><p>They worked with him to secure the woman shelter for the night, a pre-paid cab ride to get her to that shelter and a chaperoned train ride back to Las Vegas the next day, where she was reunited with a family member. Arian took care of the young women until she was placed in the cab, and even gave her his personal cell phone number in case she needed anything else.</p>",

The officers, however, observed that the alleged victim appeared frightened and exhibited signs of malnutrition. A State Police trooper took the young woman outside, where she began to weep and beg the trooper not to let her return to the RV. She told the trooper she was being held against her will and had been abused sexually and physically by the suspects. She also said the suspects threatened to kill or injure her family. She said she had infections all over her body and couldn’t remember the last time she had anything to eat or drink, adding that several days had passed.",

She also said no one back home in Iowa considered her missing, since the suspects forced her to communicate with family members, telling them that nothing out of the ordinary was taking place.
